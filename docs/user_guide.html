        <h3>API user guide</h3>
        <p>
            An user can directly process sentences by sending a POST request directly to the gateway at the following
            address: <a
                href=https://rat-gateway.azurewebsites.net/api/process>https://rat-gateway.azurewebsites.net/api/process</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The request body should contain the "openApiDocumentUrl", "sentence" and "language", all in string format.
            The user can also specify the wanted "path" and the processing will start from identifying the query, path
            and header parameters. The response will contain the "url", the "method", the "headers" and the "body" that
            will always be an empty object for now.
        </p>
        <img id="c1" src="images/happy_flow_1.png" alt="postman response" style="width:100%;">
        <p>
            If we did not identify the exact path that matches the user sentence, the response will be a list of
            suggestions. As in the image below.
        </p>
        <img id="c2" src="images/suggestions.png" alt="postman response" style="width:100%;">
        <p>
            The user can take one of this suggestion and send another request that includes the chosen path and the
            response will be the same as in the first case presented.
        </p>

    <section id="User-Interface-Guide">
        <h3>User Interface guide</h3>
        <p>
            The home of the application has a form that allows the user to specify the link to the Open API document and
            a sentence.
        </p>
        <img id="c11" src="images/ui_home.png" alt="C4 diagram" style="width:100%;">
        <p>When the both fields are completed, the Invoke Functions buttons will be enabled and the user cand send the
            data in order to be proccesses</p>
        <img id="c12" src="images/ui_home_completed.png" alt="C4 diagram" style="width:100%;">
        <p>The result can be seen in the image below. </p>
        <img id="c13" src="images/ui_result.png" alt="C4 diagram" style="width:100%;">
        <p>We also force the user to complete the requred parameters before sending the request.</p>
        <img id="c14" src="images/ui_result_with_bearer.png" alt="C4 diagram" style="width:100%;">
        <p>After sending the request, we will display the json received from the API in the page.</p>
        <img id="c15" src="images/query_result.png" alt="C4 diagram" style="width:100%;">
        <p>For the suggestions, the user can click on one of the uptions and the inputs will be processed again.</p>

        <h3>Case studies</h3>
        <section id="spotify">
            <h4>Spotify API</h4>
            The first document we tested was the <a
                href="https://api.apis.guru/v2/specs/spotify.com/2021.8.15/openapi.json">Open API document for the
                Spotify API</a>.
            <p>Our algorithm is successful when tested more simple paths such as "/albums", "/tracks" and can identify
                the
                difference between "/albums" and "/albums/{id}" if the identifier is specified : "I want to get the
                album
                that has the id 3." </p>
            <p>It can also identify the path and parameters for more complex sentences such as "From the album that has
                the identifier 3, get me all the tracks in the market 1, with the limit of 5." as we can see in<a
                    href="#c1"> the fist image </a></p>
            <p>
                However, there are still some paths that cannot be identified such as "/me/player/devices", but this
                case can se soved by the suggestions funtionality.
            </p>
            <img id="c5" src="images/spotify.png" alt="postman response" style="width:100%;">
            <p>An aspect that was overlooked is the parameters that with names such as "user_id" which will not be
                identified.</p>
            <img id="c6" src="images/spotify2.png" alt="postman response" style="width:100%;">
        </section>
        <section id="covid">
            <h4>Covid 19 Data API</h4>
            Another document we tested was <a
                href="https://api.apis.guru/v2/specs/covid19-api.com/1.2.6/openapi.json">Open API document for the
                Covid 19 Data API</a>.
            <p>Here the paths are more simple, and the algorithm, with a little help from the suggestions feature works.
            </p>
            <img id="c7" src="images/covid.png" alt="postman response" style="width:100%;">
            <p>However, the algoritm cannot identify paths such as "/country/all" or "/help/countries". In the first
                case, we assumed that a resource can be only a noun and all will not be identified. We solved the second
                case by taking into account not only the lemma of the world, but also it's whole form used in the
                sentence. Now the path it's include in the suggestions list for a sentence such as "From help, get the
                countries.".</p>
        </section>
        <section id="youtube">
            <h4>Youtube Data API</h4>
            The last document we tested was <a
                href="https://api.apis.guru/v2/specs/googleapis.com/youtube/v3/openapi.json">Open API document for the
                Youtube Data API</a>.
            <p>The issue with this API is that each path starts with "/v3" this means that we will never be able to
                identify the exact path and we will always receive suggestions.
            </p>
            <img id="c8" src="images/youtube1.png" alt="postman response" style="width:100%;">
            <img id="c9" src="images/youtube2.png" alt="postman response" style="width:100%;">
            <p>Another issue that we have is the fact that here, there are some query parameters that are refferences to
                a schema that do not support.</p>
