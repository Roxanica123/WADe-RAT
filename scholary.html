         <h3>Proposed solution</h3>
         <p>
            We propose a multi-service application which will aggregate three micro-service and a user-friendly
            interface. These components and the overall structure can be seen in the diagram below.
         </p>

         <p>
            The user interface will allow introducing the URL to a Open API document and a sentence that describes the
            request that the user wants to make such as "From the album that has the identifier 3, get all the tracks.".

         <section id="gateway_proposed_solution">
            <h4> Gateway Service </h4>
            <p>
               The web application will send a request containing this information to a service we named “gateway”
               that
               will delegate the tasks to the other two services.

         <section id="preprocessing_proposed_solution">
            <h4> Preprocessing Service </h4>
            <p>
               The preprocessing service will download the Open API document from the provided link and curate it
               in
               order to contain only the information that we consider necessary: the paths, servers and
               components.
            </p>
            <p>
               The preprocessing service will also use a pretrained NLP model provided by <a
                  href="https://spacy.io/">Spacy.io</a> in order to extract the tokens from the sentence. Each
               token
               is described by a part of speech and a dependency. We use this information to extract the HTTP
               method
               and the target resource that the user wants. The implementation details regarding the process will
               be
               explained in the <a href="#sa:Implementation_details">next section</a>.

            <h4> Natural Language Processing Service </h4>
            <p>
               The Natural Language processing service will receive the preprocessed information and identify the
               exact path from the Open API document based on the extracted target resource (and it’s parent
               resource).<br>
               After the exact path is identified, the tokens are parsed in order to identify the parameters that
               the
               user specified for the header, path or query. The implementation details regarding the process will
               be

               The processing results will be returned to the gateway and then to the web application.

               We chose JavaScript for the gateway service as it does not require any additional processing libraries.
               For
               the web application,
               we opted for <a href="https://angular.io/">Angular</a> order to create a responsive and modern user
               interface and <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">Typescript</a> for all the JavaScript benefits

         <h3> Architecture and implementation</h3>
         <p>The overall services architecture was already shown in the <a href="#c4">previous section</a>. In this

         <section id="gateway">
            <h4> API Gateway</h4>
            <p>The front-end application will send the request to an orchestration service. This service, contained in a

            This service will validate the input and send the validated input to the preprocessing service. If the
            preprocessing step was successful,
            the result will be passed to the processing service. The final result received from the processing service
            will
            be returned to the web application.
         </section>
         <section id="preprocessing">
            <h4> Preprocessing service </h4>
            The general structure of this service can be seen in the diagram below. We will focus on the implementation
            details of the Information Extractor component.
            <p>

            <p>For the tokenization and sentence information extraction we used a prebuilt CNN model provided by Spacy.
               Specifically, spacy will process the sentence and extract for each word or punctuation it’s part of
               speech
               and
               the dependencies. For the sentence "I want to get the available seeds, for the recommendations." the
               result
               can be visualized in the image below.</p>
            <p>
               <img src="diagrams/sentence.svg" alt="spacy result for sentence" style="width:100%;">
            </p>
            <p>Firstly, in order to identify the wanted HTTP method we want to find the action that the user wants to
               make
               on the resource. This means searching for the first verb in the dependency tree that has as a direct
               child a
               noun. The resource the user targets is this first noun child.
               <br>
               Moreover we can identify the compound resources, "seeds" will be identified as the target resource, but
               we
               can also identify the nouns and adjectives that are childs of this target resource, “available seeds”.
            </p>
            <p>After the target resource is determined, we also support identifying the parent resource (or compound
               parent
               resource), a child noun of the verb token that is preceded by an adposition. The parent resource
               identifier
               will also be identified and saved.</p>
            <p>The rest of the nouns, numerals, adjectives and proper nouns placed between the target resource and the
               parent resource, or the end of the sentence. This approach was used mainly because the language model is
               not
               100% reliable and it has difficuties if identifying the correct dependencies, we need a level of
               flexibility
               in mapping the parameters provided by users.</p>
            <p>These information, the tokens, target resource, parent resource and the possible parameters will be sent
               to
               the processing service together with the useful sections of the open API document.</p>
         </section>
         <section id="processing">
            <h4> Natural Language Processing service </h4>
            <p>The NLP processing service will map the extracted token and information to the open API document.</p>
            <p>We start with finding the path from the API that matches the target resource and the parent resource.
               Here
               we take into account the identifier existente, for the parent resource and the target resource also. As a
               result, we can tell exactly that the user wants the path “/parent/{id}/target” path and not the
               “/parent/target” path or “/target/{id}” and not “/target”.
            </p>
            <p>If a specific path is not identified, we stop the processing and return the paths that contain the target
               resource as suggestions for the user. In the UI (or API), the user can specify the wanted path and the
               processing will continue from this point.</p>
            <p>The next step is processing the parameters specified for the request's headers and query. We iterate
               through
               the request parameters from the
               open API document and try to find them in the "possible parameters" tokens, together with their values.
               Also,
               for the required parameters that are not specified by the user, we will add a placeholher. As an example,
               a
               sentence such as "From the album that has the identifier 3, get me all the tracks in the market 1, with
               the
               limit of 5." the result will be the one in the image below.
            </p>
            <p>
               <img src="diagrams/processing_result.png" alt="processing result for sentence" style="width:100%;">
            </p>
            As we can see, if the Open API documents specifies the server, we can add this information to the url in
            order to provide a complete request. Otherwise, the user can provide it in the UI.

         <h3> Azure functions </h3>
         <p>
            We wanted to have three services that could easily communicate and scale independently and <a
               href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/functions/#overview">Azure Functions</a>
            was the easiest way to do so. Each service has its own Azure Function App and communicates with the other
            services through HTTPS requests. Also the major advantage of this choice is the lack of configuration needed
            in order to deploy the function in comparison to other possibilities such as a cloud virtual machine or app
            engine.

            We wanted to implement a modern and responsive user interface and Angular was the most convenient option due
            to the <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/functions/#overview">Angular Material UI
               component library</a>. This enabled us to focus on the logic of the application but still have an
            up-to-standard design.

            We used the <a href="https://spacy.io/models/en">"en_code_web_sm"</a> pretrained model and the <a
               href="https://spacy.io/api">SpacyAPI</a> as the main NLP component of our project. Spacy breaks the
            sentence into tokens and then uses a CNN neural network in order to extract the structure of the sencence
            with it's parts of speech and dependencies. With this information we can create and parse the dependencies
            graph
            in order to identify the components of the requst.

         <h4>Parameters as references in Open API</h4>
         <p>We currently don't support body parameters because most of them are refferences to a certain schema. This
            issue
            could be fixed bu parsing the schema, some properties of the schema can be refferences too. To solve this
            problem we would have to build and parse an entire tree of properties. This issue is also available for some
            query parameters.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="improve-params-list">
         <h4>List and Object query parameters</h4>
         <p>Currently, we do not support query parameters that are a list or an object. This issue can be solved by
            adding
            some additional logic. However, we cannot accurately distinguish between a list of values or a name for a
            next
            parameters. A solution would be presenting the user some templates that can be used in the sentence in these
            cases such as "[1, 2, 3]" for lists and "{"prop":"name"}" for objects.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="improve-params-model">
         <h4>Overall model accuracy</h4>
         <p>Of course, the solution for most of the problems faced in developing the project is because the model used
            cannot be 100% reliable. A solution that could improve this aspect is developing our own specialised model.
